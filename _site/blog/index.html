      <div class="entry">
        <p>I have a new paper out on arXiv with my colleagues at UMass Amherst (Ryan McKenna, Daniel Sheldon, and Gerome Miklau). This paper proposes a new method for generating differentially private synthetic data that’s tailored to one’s use case by only capturing information from the desired marginal distributions. This approach builds on prior work on generating private synthetic data by representing a data distribution as a probabilistic graphical model. See <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/synth-data-1/">this post</a> for a summary of current techniques.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>This post looks at the current state of economic methodology with respect to the realistic assumptions debate. After briefly surveying the history of economic methodology, we’ll walk through two recent arguments in the realistic assumptions debate: one in favor of instrumentalism as a theoretical ideal and the other favoring a limited form of realism in practice. In light of these arguments, I’ll argue that practitioners can still adopt some form of limited realism in practice if such an approach is a expedient guide to creating models with desirable properties.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>This post discusses three responses to Friedman 1953 (which we introduced in <a href="/economic_methodology_interpretable_ml_friedman1953/">Part II</a>). Friedman’s contention, termed the “F-Twist” by Samuelson, is that economic theories should be evaluated only on their predictions within some specified domain. The F-Twist puts Friedman on the instrumentalism end of the realism of assumptions debate. The responses by Paul Samuelson, Stanley Wong, and Dan Hausman discussed below provide various lenses though which to view the problem of the realism of assumptions and, ultimately, in my view, renders the F-Twist untenable in isolation.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>I’m currently working through Raymond Smullyan’s <a href="https://store.doverpublications.com/0486497054.html">The Gödelian Puzzle Book</a> and came across a fun problem that serves as a good starting point for new readers of Smullyan. Smullyan is well known for (among many other things) producing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Smullyan#Logic_puzzles">several books of logic puzzles</a> that introduce ideas from mathematical and philosophical logic in an accessible but still technical way. These books are often formatted where each chapter has an introduction to the relevant characters, ideas, and setting, several problems for the reader to work through, and the solutions to the problems.
<img style="float: right; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0px 0px 20px; width: 200px; height: 300px" src="https://sep.yimg.com/ca/I/yhst-137970348157658_2614_646619657" />
I’ve found that working through Smullyan’s books helps build mathematical intuition better than repeatedly walking through proofs and applications of theorems. I would much rather go through Smullyan’s Gödel book than ever see <a href="https://www.logicmatters.net/tyl/booknotes/enderton/">Enderton’s Chapter 3</a> again!</p>

        <p>In this series of posts, we will develop an analogy between the realistic assumptions debate in economic methodology and the current discussion over interpretability when using machine learning models in the wild. While this connection may seem fuzzy at first, the past seventy years or so of economic methodology offers many lessons for machine learning theorists and practitioners to avoid analysis paralysis and make progress on the interpretability issue - one way or the other. But first, what’s going on with these two debates?</p>

        <p>Here are the top three books I’ve read in 2019, presented below in chronological order by year published. While quite the cliché, the theme that emerged this year is to not judge a book by its cover. While Measure and Category by John Oxtoby appears to be a terse math treatise, it is a short, well-paced, lucid read (though requiring <a href="/measure_theory_resources/">some prerequisites</a>). Braudel’s The Structures of Everyday Life digs deeply into the minutiae of common experience in early modern Europe rather than providing overarching historical narrative. To finish, Haskel and Weslake’s Capitalism without Capital is a well-researched - if at times dull - look at intangible assets from an economic perspective whose title reminds one of a political polemic.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>When approaching measure theory for the first time, the ideas can seem opaque and unmotivated. This is amplified since many students of measure theory are not coming from a strictly mathematics background and may be approaching the material on their own outside of the classroom. In addition to first-year math graduate students and advanced math undergraduates, students in stats, economics, the hard sciences, etc. will find their way into learning measure theory. This is a guide to resources for learning measure theory that tries to keep in mind that many (myself included) approach the material with an atypical background.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>In epistemology, we often think of the things we believe as discrete propositions. For instance, you may believe that there is a computer screen in front of you. But how is this belief justified? One way of justifying a belief is by offering a reason, which can itself also be a proposition. For this next proposition, we can then ask how it is justified and so on. The regress problem asks the following question: if any of the things we believe are justified, then what is the structure of that justification? Does the justification question not just keep getting passed backward forever with reasons for reasons for reasons?</p>
