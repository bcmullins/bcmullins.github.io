## Machine Learning Interpretability and Topological Learnability

<img style="float: right; display: inline-block" width="40%" height="40%"  src="/images/model.png">

This project studies connections between the topological properties of machine learning classification models and the interpretability of those models. We introduce a rigorous grounding for the [theory of probabilisitic anchors](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/aaai18.pdf). Through this perspective, there exists a correspondence between learning theoretic solvablility and classifier interpretability.

## Multi-period Income Mobility

Historically, income mobility is measured as some function of the change in income between two time periods for some population. Recently, approaches have been developed that take advantage of multi-period data. This project aims to study and develop higher-dimensional analogues of mobility indices in two time periods that are robust to measurement error and statistical noise.

See [here for a presentation](https://bcmullins.github.io/multidim_mobility/#/) of initial results.

This project is in collaboration with my colleagues at the Fiscal Research Center at Georgia State University.

## Infinite Cycles and the Regress Problem

<img style="float: right; display: inline-block" width="25%" height="25%"  src="/images/infinitecycle.png">

This project aims to bring the recent work of Diestel and collaborators on the topological approach to infinite cycles in graphs to bear on the program of Atkinson and Peijnenburg in analyzing the justification structure of infinite chains and infinite cycles of reasoning from a probabilistic and epistemological perspective.

A draft of initial results is [here](/images/infinitism.pdf).

A sketch of this approach will be presented at the [2019 Society for Exact Philosophy conference](http://www.phil.ufl.edu/host/sep/meeting.html). See the deck for this conference [here](https://bcmullins.github.io/infinite_cycles/#/).
