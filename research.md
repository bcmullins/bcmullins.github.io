## Topology and Explainable Machine Learning

<img style="float: right; display: inline-block" width="40%" height="40%"  src="/images/model.png">

This project studies connections between the topological properties of classifiers and the explainability of their predictions. In particular, we seek to provide a rigorous foundation for rule-based explanations e.g. [Anchors](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/aaai18.pdf) and [LORE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10820) as well as provide a clear formalization of explainability for classifiers.

Working Paper: [Identifying the Most Explainable Classifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08595)

I recently gave a talk at the [UMass CS Theory Seminar](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/theory/theory-seminar/).

## Earnings Mobility and SNAP Participation in Georgia

This project investigates earnings mobility among SNAP participants using linked administrative data from the State of Georgia. The goal of this work is to better understand the earnings mobility of low-income populations and how participation in government benefits programs affects one's earnings, especially during economic downturns such as the Great Recession.

Results from this project were presented at the [National Tax Association's Annual Conference](https://ntanet.org/event/2014/11/2014-annual-conference-on-taxation/), the [Next Generation of Public Finance conference](https://aysps.gsu.edu/files/2016/01/NGPF-Conference-Schedule.pdf), the [International Conference on Administrative Data Research](https://ijpds.org/adr2019) and [discussed on WABE](https://www.wabe.org/closer-look-stone-mountains-mayor-orlando-and-more/), Atlanta's NPR affiliate. Our latest results were recently published in [Social Science Quarterly]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-10-06-earnings-mobility-great-recession.md %}).

To enable practitioners to easily work with mobility indices, we've developed an R package called [mobilityIndexR](https://github.com/bcmullins/mobilityIndexR) that can be found on CRAN.

This project is in collaboration with my colleagues at the Fiscal Research Center at Georgia State University.

## Infinite Cycles and the Regress Problem

<img style="float: right; display: inline-block" width="25%" height="25%"  src="/images/infinitecycle.png">

This project aims to bring the recent work of Diestel and collaborators on the topological approach to infinite cycles in graphs to bear on the program of Atkinson and Peijnenburg in analyzing the justification structure of infinite chains and infinite cycles of reasoning from a probabilistic and epistemological perspective.

A draft of initial results is [here](/images/infinitism.pdf).

New results from this approach were presented at the [2019 Society for Exact Philosophy conference](http://meta.phil.ufl.edu/host/sep/meeting.html?year=2019). See the deck for this conference [here](https://bcmullins.github.io/infinite_cycles/#/).

## Differential Privacy for Spatial and Temporal Data

This project centers around participating in the [NIST 2020 Differential Privacy Challenge](https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/open-innovation-prize-challenges/current-and-upcoming-prize-challenges/2020-differential) with my colleagues in the [DREAM Lab](http://dbgroup.cs.umass.edu/) at UMass Amherst. This competition aims at developing new DP algorithms that incorporate and account for spatial and temporal information.

Results: [Sprint 1](https://www.drivendata.co/blog/differential-privacy-winners-sprint1/) - [Sprint 2](https://www.drivendata.co/blog/differential-privacy-winners-sprint2/) - [Sprint 3](https://www.drivendata.co/blog/differential-privacy-winners-sprint3/)
