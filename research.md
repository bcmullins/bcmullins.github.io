## Differentially Private Synthetic Data

This project seeks to advance methods for generating and working with differentially private synthetic data.

We recently presented [a paper]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2022-03-20-aim-synthetic-data.md %}) at VLDB 2022 introducing AIM, a state-of-the-art workload-adaptive synthetic data generation mechanism.

## Topology and Explainable Machine Learning

<img style="float: right; display: inline-block" width="40%" height="40%"  src="/images/model.png">

This project studies connections between the rule-based explanations of classifiers and definability in topology and seeks to provide a formal grounding for explanation methods such as [Anchors](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/aaai18.pdf) and [LORE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10820).

In Fall 2021, I gave a talk at the [UMass CS Theory Seminar](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/theory/theory-seminar/). In Spring 2023, I presented [a paper]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2023-01-24-shape-of-explanations.md %}) at the [AAAI Human-Centric AI Workshop](https://r2hcai.github.io/AAAI-23/).

## Earnings Mobility and SNAP Participation in Georgia

This project investigates earnings mobility among SNAP participants using linked administrative data from the State of Georgia. The goal of this work is to better understand the earnings mobility of low-income populations and how participation in government benefits programs affects one's earnings, especially during economic downturns such as the Great Recession.

Results from this project were presented at the [National Tax Association's Annual Conference](https://ntanet.org/event/2014/11/2014-annual-conference-on-taxation/), the [Next Generation of Public Finance conference](https://aysps.gsu.edu/files/2016/01/NGPF-Conference-Schedule.pdf), the [International Conference on Administrative Data Research](https://ijpds.org/adr2019) and [discussed on WABE](https://www.wabe.org/closer-look-stone-mountains-mayor-orlando-and-more/), Atlanta's NPR affiliate. Our latest results were recently published in [Social Science Quarterly]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-10-06-earnings-mobility-great-recession.md %}).

To enable practitioners to easily work with mobility indices, we've developed an R package called [mobilityIndexR](https://github.com/bcmullins/mobilityIndexR) that can be found on CRAN.

This project is in collaboration with my colleagues at the Fiscal Research Center at Georgia State University.

## Infinite Cycles and the Regress Problem

<img style="float: right; display: inline-block" width="25%" height="25%"  src="/images/infinitecycle.png">

This project aims to bring the recent work of Diestel and collaborators on the topological approach to infinite cycles in graphs to bear on the program of Atkinson and Peijnenburg in analyzing the justification structure of infinite chains and infinite cycles of reasoning from a probabilistic and epistemological perspective.

New results from this approach were presented at the [2019 Society for Exact Philosophy conference](http://meta.phil.ufl.edu/host/sep/meeting.html?year=2019). See the deck for this conference [here](https://bcmullins.github.io/infinite_cycles/#/).
