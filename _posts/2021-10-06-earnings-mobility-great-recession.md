I have a new paper in [Social Science Quarterly](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ssqu.13083) with my collaborators Dave Sjoquist and Sally Wallace at Georgia State University. This paper compares earnings mobility for low-wage workers before and after the Great Recession using linked administrative data from the state of Georgia. This work utilizes our [_mobilityIndexR_](https://github.com/bcmullins/mobilityIndexR) R package to estimate transition matrices and calculate mobility indices i.e. measures of mobility. [Click here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-01-20-introducing-mobilityindexr.md %}) for an introduction to the package.

Abstract:
> We calculate earnings mobility indices for low-wage workers for 7-year periods to explore the
differences in mobility between the pre- and post-Great Recession periods. We find that mobility
is greater in the post-Great Recession period. We also calculate three-year mobility indices for
the period 2000 â€“ 2015 and find that there is substantial variation in mobility indices in the post-
2007 period. We also find that the variation in three-year mobility indices over the period 2000 -
2015 is closely related to the unemployment rate.

The preprint is available [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/papers/economicMobilityGR-preprint.pdf).
