title: New Talk - Measuring Income Mobility under Differential Privacy
categories: DifferentialPrivacy NewPaper
---

I recently gave a talk at the [Privacy and Public Policy Conference](https://privacypublicpolicy-conference.github.io/website/) on measuring income mobility under differential privacy. This is joint work with [Miguel Fuentes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wy3LBgsAAAAJ&hl=en) that combines techniques from [differentially private query answering]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-10-04-gremlnn.md %}) with methods for [measuring mobility in economics]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-10-06-earnings-mobility-great-recession.md %}). I've had this project idea on the backburner for a while, and it was great to finally work on it and share it with the community. Slides for the talk are available below. This project is still a work in progress!
