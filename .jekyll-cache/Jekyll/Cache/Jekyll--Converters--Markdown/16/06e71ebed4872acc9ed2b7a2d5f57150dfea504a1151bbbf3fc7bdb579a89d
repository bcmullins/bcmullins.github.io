I"Ð<p>Iâ€™m currently working through Raymond Smullyanâ€™s <a href="https://store.doverpublications.com/0486497054.html">The GÃ¶delian Puzzle Book</a> and came across a fun problem that serves as a good starting point for new readers of Smullyan. Smullyan is well known for (among many other things) producing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Smullyan#Logic_puzzles">several books of logic puzzles</a> that introduce ideas from mathematical and philosophical logic in an accessible but still technical way. These books are often formatted where each chapter has an introduction to the relevant characters, ideas, and setting, several problems for the reader to work through, and the solutions to the problems.

Iâ€™ve found that working through Smullyanâ€™s books helps build mathematical intuition better than repeatedly walking through proofs and applications of theorems. I would much rather go through Smullyanâ€™s GÃ¶del book than ever see <a href="https://www.logicmatters.net/tyl/booknotes/enderton/">Endertonâ€™s Chapter 3</a> again!</p>
