I"º<p>This post introduces <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman">Milton Friedman‚Äôs</a> 1953 essay <em>The Methodology of Positive Economics</em> which takes the position that economic theories should be evaluated only on their predictions within some specified domain. This article <a href="https://tint.helsinki.fi/publications/maki,%20readingF53.pdf">has been called</a> ‚Äúthe most cited, the most influential, and the most controversial piece of methodological writing in 20th century economics‚Äù and plays the foil (and occasionally the bogeyman) in much of the economic methodology literature. This is so much so that it is often referred to as Friedman 1953 or even F53.</p>
