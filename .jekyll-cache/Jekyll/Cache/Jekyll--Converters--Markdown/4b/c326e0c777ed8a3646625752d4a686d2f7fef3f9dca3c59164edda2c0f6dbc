I"<p>I recently moved to a <a href="https://system76.com">System76</a> Darter Pro running <a href="https://system76.com/pop">Pop!_OS 19.10</a> as my primary laptop (review coming soon). As you might have guessed by the version number, Pop!_OS is System76’s fork of Ubuntu. With this move, I switched to <a href="https://shadow.tech">Shadow</a> as my cloud gaming service, since they have a supported Linux client - no messing with Wine, dual boots, or VMs required! The Shadow Linux client is built to be compatible with 18.04+ but didn’t work right away due to some <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Hardware_video_acceleration">Video Acceleration</a> issues. Below is a guide for getting Shadow running on 19.10 based on my experience troubleshooting.</p>
