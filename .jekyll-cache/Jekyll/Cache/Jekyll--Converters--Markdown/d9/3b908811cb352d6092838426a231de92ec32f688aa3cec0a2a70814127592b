I"ê<p>This post discusses three responses to Friedman 1953 (which we introduced in <a href="/economic_methodology_interpretable_ml_friedman1953/">Part II</a>). Friedman‚Äôs contention, termed the ‚ÄúF-Twist‚Äù by Samuelson, is that economic theories should be evaluated only on their predictions within some specified domain. The F-Twist puts Friedman on the instrumentalism end of the realism of assumptions debate. The responses by Paul Samuelson, Stanley Wong, and Dan Hausman discussed below provide various lenses though which to view the problem of the realism of assumptions and, ultimately, in my view, renders the F-Twist untenable in isolation.</p>
