		<h2>Current Projects</h2>
		<h3>Multidimensional Income Mobility</h3>
		<p>
			Historically, income mobility is measured as some function of the change in income between two time periods for some population. Recently, approaches have been developed that take advantage of multi-period data. This project aims to study and develop higher-dimensional analogues of mobility indices in two time periods that are robust to measurement error and statistical noise.
			<br>
			<br>
			See <a href="https://bcmullins.github.io/multidim_mobility/#/">here for a presentation</a> of initial results.
			<br>
			<br>
			This project is in collaboration with my colleages at the Fiscal Research Center at Georgia State University.

		<h3>Infinite Cycles and the Regress Problem</h3>
		<img id="rightimg" src="img/infinitecycle.png"></img>
		<p>
			This project aims to bring the recent work of Diestel and collaborators on the topological approach to infinite cycles in graphs to bear on the program of Atkinson and Peijnenburg in analyzing the justification structure of infinite chains and infinite cycles of reasoning from a probabilistic and epistemological perspective.
			<br>
			<br>
			A draft of initial results is <a href="infinitism.pdf">here</a>.
		</p>

		<h3>Formal Ethics and Cold War Rationality</h3>
		<p>
			To what extent does the work of moral philosophers in the 1960s-1980s such as David Gauthier and John Rawls fit into the Cold War Rationality Research Program?
		</p>

		<h3>What is fidelity anyway? Reflections on Post-Hoc Prediction Explanations</h3>
		<p>
			Much of the model interpretation literature is focused on post-hoc or after-the-fact explanations of particular predictions from an arbitrary model and what properties these explanations ought to have. If we conceive of model explanations as models themselves, then we may have black-box (not interpretable) explanations of white-box (intrepretable) models and vice versa. This project investigates the interplay between white-boxes, black-boxes, and the hierarchy of best explanations from the perspective of interpreting predictions from machine learning models.
